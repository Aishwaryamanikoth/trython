HANGMAN GAME 
-------------
Hangman is a classic word guessing game. In this Python project, players are challenged to guess letters to reveal a hidden word. 
Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn. The objective is to guess the word before the hangman is completed.

Usage
------
To play the Hangman game, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the game:
python hangman.py

The game will prompt you to enter your guesses for letters. Enter a letter and press Enter to make a guess.

If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. If your guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.

Continue making guesses until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is completed.

If you guess the word correctly, you win the game! If the hangman is completed before you guess the word, you lose.
